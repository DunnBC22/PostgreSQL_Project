# PostgreSQL_Project

This project required some ETL, so I used Python (and Pandas) to make the necessary changes. I used the COPY command to do a bulk import/insert. After that, I queried the information using a plethora of available options within PostgreSQL.

I initially thought that I had to run a bulk INSERT statement to import all of the information. Instead of deleting the code, I decided to just comment it out (because the code did work as intended, it was just unnecessary).
